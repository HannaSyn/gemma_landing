Tortured children, their mothers who died of starvation, raped women, executed men shot in the back of the head. All these are victims of the inhuman, racist regime. Ukraine is defending the whole of Europe, the entire Western world. It is Ukraine that covers the whole civilization with its back. But capacity in the middle of the country is not enough.
